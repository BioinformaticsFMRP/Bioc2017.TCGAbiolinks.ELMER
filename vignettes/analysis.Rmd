# Introduction

Another Bioconductor package we will also be introduce is called 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) [@yao2015inferring,@elmer2] which allows 
one to identify DNA methylation changes in distal regulatory regions and correlate 
these signatures with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional 
targets associated with cancer. For these distal probes correlated with a gene, 
a transcription factor motif analysis is performed followed by expression 
analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators.

We expect that participants of this workshop will understand the integrative 
analysis performed by using 
[TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks/) + 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/), as well as be able to execute 
it from the data acquisition process to the final interpretation of the results. 
The workshop assumes users with an intermediate level of familiarity with R, 
and basic understanding of tumor biology. 

The figure below highlights the workflow part which will be covered in this section.

## Loading required libraries

```{r vignette, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning = FALSE}
library(ELMER)
library(DT)
library(dplyr)
```

# ELMER data input


A Multi Assay Experiment object from the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MultiAssayExperiment")` 
package is the input for multiple main functions of `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ELMER")`. 
To create it you can use the `createMAE` function.

But instead of using the data previously downloaded, we will use one with more samples provided
in this package.
```{r data, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
lusc.exp
lusc.met
```

Also, we will need to filter the probes in the MAE to select only distal probes.
```{r distal probes, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
distal.probes <- get.feature.probe(genome = "hg38", met.platform = "450K")
```

The `createMAE` function will receive both DNA methylation and gene expression objects.
Also `filter.probes` argument will select only probes in the regions of the distal.probes
object. 

```{r mae, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
mae <- createMAE(exp = lusc.exp, 
                 met = lusc.met,
                 save = TRUE,
                 linearize.exp = TRUE,
                 filter.probes = distal.probes,
                 save.filename = "mae_bioc2017.rda",
                 met.platform = "450K",
                 genome = "hg19",
                 TCGA = TRUE)
mae
colData(mae)[1:5,] %>%  as.data.frame %>% datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
sampleMap(mae)[1:5,] %>%  as.data.frame %>% datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```


# Analysis

## Identifying differentially methylated probes

This step is to identify DNA methylation changes at distal enhancer probes which is
carried out by function `get.diff.meth`.

For each distal probe, the function first rank samples from group 1 and group 2 samples by their DNA methylation beta values. 
To identify hypomethylated probes, the function compared the lower control quintile (20\% of control samples with the lowest methylation) 
to the lower experiment quintile (20\% of experiment samples with the lowest methylation), using an unpaired one-tailed t-test.

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Main get.diff.meth arguments </div>
<div class="panel-body">
| Argument | Description |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| data | A `multiAssayExperiment` with DNA methylation and Gene Expression data. See `createMAE` function. |
| diff.dir |  A character can be "hypo" or "hyper", showing differential methylation dirction.  It can be "hypo" which is only selecting hypomethylated probes;  "hyper" which is only selecting hypermethylated probes |
| minSubgroupFrac |  A number ranging from 0 to 1,specifying the fraction of extreme samples from group 1 and group 2  that are used to identify the differential DNA methylation.  The default is 0.2 because we typically want to be able to detect a specific (possibly unknown) molecular subtype among tumor; these subtypes often make up only a minority of samples, and 20\% was chosen as a lower bound for the purposes of statistical power. If you are using pre-defined group labels, such as treated replicates vs. untreated replicated, use a value of 1.0 (***Supervised*** mode) |
| pvalue | A number specifies the significant P value (adjusted P value by BH) cutoff for selecting significant hypo/hyper-methylated probes. Default is 0.01 |
| group.col | A column defining the groups of the sample. You can view the available columns using: `colnames(MultiAssayExperiment::colData(data))`. |
| group1 | A group from group.col. ELMER will run group1 vs group2. That means, if direction is hyper, get probes hypermethylated in group 1 compared to group 2. |
| group2 | A group from group.col. ELMER will run group1 vs group2. That means, if direction is hyper, get probes hypermethylated in group 1 compared to group 2. |
| sig.dif | A number specifies the smallest DNA methylation difference as a cutoff for selecting significant hypo/hyper-methylated probes. Default is 0.3. |

</div>

```{r,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
sig.diff <- get.diff.meth(data = mae, 
                          group.col = "definition",
                          group1 =  "Primary solid Tumor",

                          minSubgroupFrac = 0.2,
                          sig.dif = 0.3,
                          diff.dir = "hypo", # Search for hypomethylated probes in group 1

                          dir.out ="result", 
                          pvalue = 0.01)

```{r,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
as.data.frame(sig.diff)  %>% datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
# get.diff.meth automatically save output files. 
# getMethdiff.hypo.probes.csv contains statistics for all the probes.
# getMethdiff.hypo.probes.significant.csv contains only the significant probes which
# is the same with sig.diff
dir(path = "result", pattern = "getMethdiff")  
```

## Identifying putative probe-gene pairs

This step is to link enhancer probes with methylation changes to target genes with expression
changes and report the putative target gene for selected probes. This is carried out
by function `get.pair`. 

For each distal probe with differential methylation the closest 10 upstream 
genes and the closest 10 downstream genes were tested for correlation between 
methylation of the probe and expression of the gene.
Thus, exactly 20 statistical 
tests were performed for each probe, as follows. For each probe-gene pair, 
the samples (all experiment samples and control samples) were divided into two 
groups: the M group, which consisted of the upper methylation quintile (the 20\%
of samples with the highest methylation at the enhancer probe), and the U group, 
which consisted of the lowest methylation quintile (the 20\% of samples with the 
lowest methylation.)
For each probe-gene pair tested, the raw p-value `Pr` was corrected for multiple 
hypothesis using a permutation approach.

## Motif enrichment analysis on the selected probes

This step is to identify enriched motif in a set of probes which is carried out by
function `get.enriched.motif`.

This function uses a pre-calculated data `Probes.motif` which was generated using HOMER with a $p-value \le 10^{–4}$ 
to scan a $\pm250bp$  region around each probe using HOmo sapiens 
COmprehensive MOdel COllection [http://hocomoco.autosome.ru/](HOCOMOCO) v10 [@kulakovskiy2016hocomoco] position
weight matrices (PWMs). 
For each probe set tested (i.e. the list of gene-linked hypomethylated probes in a given 
group), a motif enrichment Odds Ratio and a 95% confidence interval were 
calculated using following formulas:
$$ p= \frac{a}{a+b} $$
$$ P= \frac{c}{c+d} $$
$$ Odds\quad  Ratio = \frac{\frac{p}{1-p}}{\frac{P}{1-P}} $$
$$ SD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}+\frac{1}{d}} $$
$$ lower\quad boundary\quad of\quad  95\%\quad  confidence\quad  interval = \exp{(\ln{OR}-SD)} $$

where `a` is the number of probes within the selected probe set that contain one 
or more motif occurrences; `b` is the number of probes within the selected probe 
set that do not contain a motif occurrence; `c` and `d` are the same counts within 
the entire enhancer probe set. A probe set was considered significantly enriched 
for a particular motif if the 95% confidence interval of the Odds Ratio was 
greater than 1.1 (specified by option `lower.OR`, 1.1 is default), and the motif 
occurred at least 10 times (specified by option `min.incidence`. 10 is default) in 
the probe set. As described in the text, Odds Ratios were also used for ranking 
candidate motifs.

| probes | A vector lists the name of probes to define the set of probes in which motif enrichment OR and confidence interval will be calculated. |
| lower.OR | A number specifies the smallest lower boundary of 95% confidence interval for Odds Ratio. The motif with higher lower boudnary of 95% confidence interval for Odds Ratio than the number are the significantly enriched motifs (detail see reference). |
| min.incidence | A non-negative integer specifies the minimum incidence of motif in the given probes set. 10 is default. |

dir(path = "result", pattern = "motif.enrichment.pdf") 
```


## Identifying regulatory TFs


This step is to identify regulatory TF whose expression associates with TF binding motif 
DNA methylation which is carried out by function `get.TFs`.

For each motif considered to be enriched within a particular probe set, it will
compare the average DNA methylation at all distal enhancer probes within $\pm250bp$  
of a motif occurrence, to the expression of human TFs. A statistical test 
was performed for each motif-TF pair, as follows. The samples (all groups samples) 
were divided into two groups: the M group, which consisted 
of the 20\% of samples with the highest average methylation at all motif-adjacent 
probes, and the U group, which consisted of the 20\% of samples with the lowest 
methylation. For each candidate motif-TF pair, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to test 
the null hypothesis that overall gene expression in group M was greater or equal 
than that in group U.
All TFs were ranked by the $-log_{10}(P_{r})$, and those falling within the top 5% of 
this ranking were considered candidate upstream regulators.
