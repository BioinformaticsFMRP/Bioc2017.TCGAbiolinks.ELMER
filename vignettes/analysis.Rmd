# Introduction

Another Bioconductor package will also be introduced called 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) which allows 
one to identify DNA methylation changes in distal regulatory regions and correlate 
these signatures with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional 
targets associated with cancer. For these distal probes correlated with a gene, 
a transcription factor motif analysis is performed followed by expression 
analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators.

We expect that participants of this workshop will understand the integrative 
analysis performed by using 
[TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks/) + 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/), as well as be able to execute 
it from the data acquisition process to the final interpretation of the results. 
The workshop assumes users with an intermediate level of familiarity with R, 
and basic understanding of tumor biology. 

The figure below hihglights the workflow part which will be covered in this section.

         dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Accessing the vignette 
The vignette can be laucnhed with the following command:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
library("BioinformaticsFMRP/Bioc2017.TCGAbiolinks.ELMER")
bioc2017()
```
